RIPL Is Pythonic LISP
=====================

RIPL started as a weekend tinkering with some of the ideas from Peter Norvig's
[lis.py scheme interpretor](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) and has grown into a
side project where I try to hack my favourite language features from other
languages into python with the goal of direct interpretation or generating a
Python source file. (OK, where I try to hack my favourite parts of Haskell
into Python...and some other stuff too.)

Other than for the fun of implementing a LISP interpretor inside of Python,
my end goal for this is to be able to quickly and easily write some data
piplining tools.

We'll see how that goes...

RIPL is still very hacky so bare with me!
