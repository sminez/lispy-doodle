LISPy Doodles
=============

I have my own preferred syntax for a LISP. It's a little bit of scheme, a little
bit of Clojure and pieces of Python for naming conventions and expectations.

Here are my attempts at building implementations of this idea in a couple of
different languages!


### RIPL - RIPL Is Pythonic LISP
`*.rpl`

### GIGL - GIGL Is Goroutine LISP (but not yet...)
`*.ggl`

### PICL - PICL Is Crustacean LISP
`*.pcl`

### FIKL - FIKL Is Kotlin LISP
`*.fkl`
